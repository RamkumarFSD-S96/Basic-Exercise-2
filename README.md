**Website Description**  

This website is built using **HTML and CSS**, with a structured layout and styled using modern web design principles. The key features of the website are as follows:  

1. **Display Property:**  
   - The layout uses various CSS `display` properties such as `block`, `inline-block`, and `flex` to arrange elements effectively.  
   - The navigation bar and the table are displayed as `block` elements to occupy the full width, while the four product showcase blocks are styled using `inline-block` for side-by-side alignment.  

2. **CSS Box Model:**  
   - All elements on the page, including the navigation bar, product containers, and table, are styled with the **CSS Box Model**.  
   - Elements have defined `margin` for spacing, `padding` for inner content spacing, and `border` for visual separation.  
   - The container divs also utilize `width` and `height` properties for consistent dimensions and alignment.  

3. **CSS Selectors:**  
   - A variety of CSS selectors are used to target and style elements efficiently:  
     - **Element Selectors:** Styling tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, and `<button>`.  
     - **Class Selectors:** Used for reusable styles applied to multiple elements, such as `.nav-bar`, `.container`, and `.product-box`.

     - **ID Selectors:** Unique styles for specific elements like `#submit-button`.  
     - **Pseudo-classes:** For hover effects on buttons (e.g., `button:hover`).  

4. **CSS Basic Styles:**  
   - The website is styled with basic CSS properties for an elegant and user-friendly appearance:  
     - **Text Styles:** Fonts, `text-align` (center), `font-size`, and `color` properties are used to enhance typography.  
     - **Background Styles:** Background colors and images are applied for visual appeal.  
     - **Borders and Shadows:** Borders and box-shadows are used to give depth and structure to the elements.  
     - **Buttons and Interactivity:** The "Order Now" and "Send" buttons are styled with hover effects for a dynamic user experience.
